!!!! Which core questions and processing steps do I have to consider before calculating a biomass potential? <br>
!!!! Can I transfer the given scheme to other biomasses?

In this chapter, we will show you, using grain straw as an example, which key questions you need to answer before you can carry out a potential calculation. In order to calculate the technical potential and above all to be able to make statements about the development of the unused technical potential, these core questions / processing steps are decisive:

- Which individual biomass is taken into account? What type of biomass is it?
- Which restrictions and competing uses must be taken into account?
- Which energetic utilisation paths for biomass exist?
- Which factors are necessary to calculate the potential?
- How can the results be cartographically processed in such a way that even laypersons can interpret them well?
