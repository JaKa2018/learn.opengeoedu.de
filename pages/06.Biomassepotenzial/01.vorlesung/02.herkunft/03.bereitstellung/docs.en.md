In this learning module, the focus will be on potential considerations for the energetic use of biomass. Like any type of energy production, the energetic use of biomass is associated with opportunities and risks (see table below). Sustainable provision is a fundamental prerequisite for the contribution to the energy system and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions already mentioned. When using biogenic resources, the principle of "food first" should therefore generally apply, i.e. the cultivation of food has priority over energy use. At the same time, biomass use must be accompanied by a sustainable carbon balance (e.g. preservation of valuable habitats), sustainable management of agricultural and forestry land and sustainable consumption (Thr√§n et al. 2016). How these factors can be taken into account is described in this chapter using the example of some use paths. Information on how questions of sustainability can be incorporated into potential calculations can also be found in the further course of the lecture and the respective exercises.

**Table: Possible opportunities and risks of the energetic use of biomass**

| Opportunities of the energetic use of biomass | Risks of the energetic use of biomass |
|-|-|
| High flexibility, good storage capacity: compensation of fluctuating production, e.g. by wind power or solar energy | Possible competition for use (e.g. for food and animal feed production)|
| Decentralised Energy Supply, Rural Development | Direct or Indirect Land Use Changes |
| Can be used in a variety of ways (heat, electricity, fuels) | Undesirable environmental effects (e.g. through the cultivation of monocultures) |
| Environmentally and climate-friendly CO2 savings | Often dependent on subsidies, as otherwise not economical |

!! Can you think of further advantages and risks of the energetic use of biomass? <br> <br>
!! Do you notice anything about the risks? What type of biomass do these negative aspects primarily relate to?

At the beginning of this chapter, a distinction was made between renewable raw materials or cultivated biomass and residual and waste materials. Many competing uses concern above all the cultivation of renewable raw materials. Although the potential competing uses are less pronounced when residual and waste materials are considered, certain restrictions must also be taken into account here. These include, for example, possible or actual use as animal feed, bedding or fertiliser. Therefore, we will take into account competition in the use of the GIS exercises. Using the example of *cascade use*, a possible solution for minimising competition for use is described below.
