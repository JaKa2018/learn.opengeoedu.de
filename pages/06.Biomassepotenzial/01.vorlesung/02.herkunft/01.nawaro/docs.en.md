By "renewable raw materials" we mean agricultural and forestry products in this part of the course that are not grown for the production of food and feed, but specifically for energetic (*energy crops*) or material (industrial crops) uses. In many publications, the term "renewable raw materials" only refers to agricultural products. If you deal with figures on the cultivation and use of renewable raw materials, find out whether forestry products have also been included. 

Since 1990, the energetic use of biomass has increased strongly in Germany. As can be seen from the figure below, renewable raw materials are currently cultivated in Germany on about 2.7 million ha or 22% of the agricultural land. Of these, about 90% are energy crops, which are mainly used for biogas and fuel production. (Agency for Renewable Resources e. V.) (FNR) 2018)

The most frequent crops cultivated in Germany for material and energy uses (as of 2016) are shown in the figure below.
