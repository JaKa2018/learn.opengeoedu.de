The potential levels can be translated into different potential types, which can be used to make a statement about the relevance of biomass. The following terms have become established in literature and research (Kaltschmitt et al. 2016; Thrän and Pfeiffer 2013). However, this nomenclature is not obligatory; therefore, these terms must be defined and further concretized within the framework of a project in order to enable the comparison of results. 

- Theoretical potential
- Technical potential
- Economic potential
- Sustainable potential
- Developable potential
