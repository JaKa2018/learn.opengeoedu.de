Let's get back to the key questions asked at the beginning:

- What quantities of biogenic resources can we use sustainably?
- Where are the resources?
- What contribution can biomass make to the transformation of energy systems (or to the bioeconomy in general)?

In the previous chapters, you have already acquired knowledge about the available and exploited potential of renewable raw materials and biogenic residual and waste materials in Germany. This information concentrates on the national level. However, biogenic resources are spatially distributed differently. The economic use of biogenic resources therefore requires intelligent and biomass-specific supply concepts. Especially for the mobilisation of unused biomass potentials from the field of residual and waste materials or for the optimisation of already established material flows, the location of a biomass accumulation is an important key information. Due to low energy densities, the transport value and thus the maximum transport distance of many biogenic residual and waste materials is particularly limited. At the same time, bioenergy plants require minimum quantities in order to operate economically and ecologically.

By linking open data sets (geodata, statistics, specialist data), potential information can be processed with the aid of geo-information systems (GIS) in such a way that preferential regions or locations (from the raw material point of view) for certain bioenergy plants can be identified. Depending on the issue at hand, this can be done at the level of administrative units (e.g. federal states, districts, municipalities) or independently of administrative structures (km², arable land). Figure 12 shows the grain raw potential for Germany both at district level and by km².

!! Compare the two cards. Which statement on straw potentials can you make? What influence does the spatial reference have on the significance of the maps?  <br><br>
!! In preparation for the exercises, consider which open geodata sets and statistics you know and whether these could be suitable for the spatial representation of biomass potentials. <br><br>
!! In the following example, the technical potential of the biomass "grain straw" is determined. Use these examples and the information from the previous chapters to start thinking about how you can present biomass potentials with geodata.
