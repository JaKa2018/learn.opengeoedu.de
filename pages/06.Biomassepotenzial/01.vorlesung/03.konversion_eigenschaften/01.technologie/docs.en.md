Due to the diversity of biomasses and their different energetic, chemical and physical properties, there is a wide range of conversion technologies based on the initial biomass, which can be divided into _biochemical_, _physical-chemical_ and _thermo-chemical_ conversion processes_ (cf. Kaltschmitt et al. 2016, Thr√§n 2015). In the following figure you will find an overview of existing technologies. Due to the high number of possible conversion paths, individual technologies are not discussed here. If you require information on a conversion path for editing the exercises, you will be provided with self-study documents in the exercise.

!! Which biomasses, conversion technologies and end products have you already had contact with?
