After you have acquired basic knowledge of biomass and potential calculation in the lecture, we will go into more detail in the exercises to answer the following key questions:

- What quantities of biogenic resources can we use sustainably?
- Where are the resources located?
- What contribution can biomass make to energy system transformation (or to the bioeconomy in general)?

Using exercises at regional, national and international level, you will develop answers to these questions for different biomass types.
